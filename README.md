# Amogus-keyboard à¶ž
This program here makes you keyboard sound really sussy.
The code of this is really sketchy and confusing, but I hope you can figure your how to modify it to your heart's content. 
I will also maybe make some updates for it if I will have the motivation and energy for it.
## What key plays what:
  If you press ``Space`` you will hear -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPiEAI5RTKM
  
  If you press ``Enter`` -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KfC923EFsY
  
  If you press ``Backspace`` -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeGJqz3MslE 
  
  The keys form ``num 0 - 6`` -> They make random beats from this melody: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grd-K33tOSM
  
  If you press any key -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqA94Blvxao
  
  **The num keys don't play specific notes, but in the next update, I will make it so that you can properly play something on it.**
  
  ## How it was made:
It was written in Visual Studio 2019. I used a Nuget package (System.Windows.Extensions), you can install it easily it is listed in the dependencies in the solution explorer. The project was published with Clickone (it is a default option in visual studio).
  ## Thank you! :D
